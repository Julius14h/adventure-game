# Text-Based Adventure Game (JavaFX)

## Overview
This is a text-based adventure game developed in JavaFX as part of a course project. The game allows players to explore a story through text input and features interactive UI elements. This repository contains the source code and resources for the project.

## My Contribution
- although part-1 was an individual submission, part-2 was a group effort where I worked with three other students to enhance the game from part-1.
- **Zoom Feature**: Players can increase or decrease the text size using the zoom-in/zoom-out controls, implemented via decorator classes that wrap the base text component.
- **Save/Load/Delete**: Where the original game only supported the ability to load and save files, I added the functionality for it to delete files.
- **My Files**: The files I contributed to were AdventureGameViewAbstract, AdventureGameViewDecorator, EnhancedAdventureGameViewDecorator, DeleteView in part-2/assignment2/views as well as DeleteSaveCommand, and ZoomCommands

These features were built to integrate seamlessly with the core game logic developed by my team.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaFX**: For the gameâ€™s UI and event handling.
- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Applied to extend zoom functionality dynamically.
